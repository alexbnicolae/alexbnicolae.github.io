Web Site made in React.js.



Idea of this site was to find movies based on an API.

The API used: https://www.themoviedb.org



The site has:

- Home page

- Not found page

- Search Page (when you type you are redirected on a page where you can see what you search by typing)

- Search View page, where you can see what you searched

- Movie details page, where you can see the details about the movie (title, plot, poster)
